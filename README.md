**Name:** Levin Ekuam  
**Student ID:** m669913  

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my solution to **DSA 2040A – Lab 3: Practicing Extraction in ETL**.  
The lab demonstrates the two main types of data extraction used in ETL processes:

- **Full Extraction:** Load and display the entire dataset.
- **Incremental Extraction:** Load only new records added since the last extraction.

All code is implemented in Python using pandas within a Jupyter Notebook.
