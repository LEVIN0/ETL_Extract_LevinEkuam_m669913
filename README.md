# ETL Extract Lab ‚Äì DSA 2040A

**Name:** Levin Ekuam  
**Student ID:** m669913  

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains my solution to **DSA 2040A ‚Äì Lab 3: Practicing Extraction in ETL**.  
The lab demonstrates the two main types of data extraction used in ETL processes:

- **Full Extraction:** Load and display the entire dataset.
- **Incremental Extraction:** Load only new records added since the last extraction.

All code is implemented in Python using pandas within a Jupyter Notebook.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- **Python 3.12+**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and CSV file handling.
- **Faker**: A library for generating synthetic data to populate the dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment for coding, documenting, and testing the ETL extraction logic.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and submission platform.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Open etl_extract.ipynb in Jupyter.
Run all cells to perform full extraction and simulate incremental extraction.
Dataset used: custom_data.csv

## Files used 
etl_extract.ipynb: Notebook with all ETL logic.
custom_data.csv: Generated dataset.
last_extraction.txt: Timestamp for incremental extraction.
.gitignore: To ignore unneeded files in Git.

through this we can see that we performed a full extraction and it pulled all 100 rows and then we went on to perform a incremental extraction where it pulled 34 rows since it was last updated

we then went on to save the new updated time stamp so that the next time data is pulled it will be pulled from this new date
